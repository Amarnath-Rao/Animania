Project Details:-
As part of theme "Digital Transformation", our team aimed to use Decentralizaed Application using Blockchain Technology

Vision:

Everybody would have played deck cards in their life, challenging others with their cards, buying them, selling them and battleing with "Atk" "Def" "Spd" "Health" stats to other players cards

So we aimed to provide a decentralized version of this daily life fun and challenging game

We will provide users to upload their Charecter card using "IPFS" in dapp

So, enable trustworthy transactions and agreements to be made between dispersed, anonymous participants without the need for a centralised authority, a legal system, or an external enforcement mechanism. The key advantages of using are:
•Speed, efficiency and accuracy
•Trust and transparency
•Security
•Resource optimisation

Tech Stacks use:

Solidity
ReactJS
NextJS
Hardhat
Tailwind css
Polygon 
Ethereum
IPFS

Default content:-

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
